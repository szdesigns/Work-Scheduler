# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
To make an interactive 9 to 5 work scheduler which records your submissions in local storage. Every person has a hard time remembering exactly what they have to do today, and sometimes google calendar is just a bit too much. For those times when you just want to write down a simple to do list and have it be saved locally try out my app!


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
